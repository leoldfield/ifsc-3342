                <h2>Pre-Assessment</h2>
                <p>This was the first assignment given to us in this course. It is primarily a review of HTML and CSS basics, utilizing spacing, embedding images, and targeting specific elements with CSS.</p>

                <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
                <p>This assignment introduces different types of elements (such as header, nav, section, article, and aside). It also introduces grid-based design, which is expanded on in CSS Grid Exercise.</p>

                <h2>CSS Grid Exercise</h2>
                <p>This is where CSS grid-based design is properly practiced for the first time. We were given a template HTML (the same as Semantic HTML) and tasked with restructuring the document to use the grid system exclusively instead of floating elements.</p>

                <h2>Resume</h2>
                <p>In this project we designed a mobile-first resume utilizing JSON-LD. It is responsive with a mobile, tablet, and desktop view.</p>

                <h2>Final Project Prototype</h2>
                <p>This is the Bootstrap prototype of our final project for this course, consisting of a mobile-first website on a subject of my choosing. It has a responsive and audience-appropriate design. The subject I have chosen is to make a mockup website for the tabletop roleplaying game I have designed with basic information about the game.</p>
